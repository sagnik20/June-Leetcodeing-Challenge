I have started from 1st June in this Challenge. And this repository contains my solutions to the challenge. Only the `exact solution`. If you want to improve the solutions, Please open a `Issue first`.

## :rocket: Get Started

### Questions : 
#### Day-01 : 
**Invert Binary Tree :** 
>Invert a binary tree

**Example :**

```

Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

Output:

     4

#### Day-02 : 
**Delete Node in a inked List :** 
>Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

>Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/237_example.png)

**Example :**

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```
```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Constraints :**
+ The linked list will have at least two elements.
+ All of the nodes' values will be unique.
+ The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
+ Do not return anything from your function.
